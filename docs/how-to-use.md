### What is this extension?

This extension just takes every youtube link it can find on the page, and puts in a youtube playlist. 
It's meant to be used mostly for facebook, since now it's kinda impossible to read group posts without having a giant company behind you.

It's the most "dumb" extension ever, it only finds links that are visible on the page. So on facebook for example, make sure to expand all comments. 

### What's the diffrenece between "one-time" and "regular" playlists? 
One-time playlist can't be edited, can't be saved to your youtube playlists, but are created quickly.
Regaular playlists are saved to your youtube account, but might take up to a minute to create.
